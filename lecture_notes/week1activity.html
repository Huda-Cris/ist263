    <h1>Schine Student center: What you need to know</h1>
    <p><strong>Fenruary 10, 2021</strong></p>
    <p>It's here! here! Our newly renovated student center is open, and there’s so much to explore. Before you check it out, there’s a lot of information that you should know. To help, we’ve pulled what we think are the top 4 things. For the full information, visit the Student Centers and Programming Services (SCPS) website and their COVID-19 Guidelines.</p>
    <h2>1. What is Shine?</h2>
    <p>Some of us might remember what Schine was like before construction (and COVID). Now it’s something completely new! Here’s what you can find in Schine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Intercultural Collective, a collocated space for the Disability Cultural Center, LGBTQ Resource Center and Office of Multicultural Affairs.</li>
        <li>The Office of Student Activities with dedicated and functional work space for registered student organizations.</li>
        <li>Schine Dining with brand new food options to try, including CoreLife Eatery, Panda Express and The Halal Shack.</li>
        <li>Campus Store (formerly the Bookstore)</li>
    </ul>
